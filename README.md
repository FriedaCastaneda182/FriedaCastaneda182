## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a front-end developer passionate about creating smooth, engaging, and interactive web experiences. This repository is part of my journey into learning GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) and ScrollTrigger, two powerful tools for bringing motion and storytelling to the web.

Animations are more than just visual flairâ€”they guide users, provide feedback, and make interfaces feel alive. With GSAP, Iâ€™ve been exploring how to craft performant, timeline-based animations that run beautifully across devices and browsers. ScrollTrigger adds another layer of control, letting animations respond to scroll position, pin elements, and sync motion with user interaction.

In this repo, youâ€™ll find small projects, demos, and experiments where I apply GSAP and ScrollTrigger to build animations like smooth scroll effects, reveal-on-scroll transitions, parallax sections, and more. Iâ€™m learning how to structure animations for maintainability, manage performance, and create fluid motion that enhances the overall user experience.

Each project includes well-commented code and documentation, aimed at helping other developers who are new to GSAP or just looking for inspiration. I'm also starting to experiment with combining GSAP with popular front-end frameworks like React and Vue, exploring how to integrate animations into dynamic component-based architectures.

This repository is part sandbox, part showcase, and all about learning by doing. If you're exploring the world of front-end animation or looking to add ScrollTrigger to your toolkit, feel free to check out the code, fork a project, or share feedback.

Thanks for stopping byâ€”letâ€™s keep making the web more playful, dynamic, and fun to use! âœ¨ðŸ’»ðŸŽ¯
